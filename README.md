# OS_MiniProject

Mini project for operating systems course CUFE CMP 3rd year 

**The project consits of two modules**

*Module 1:*
Process Generator

It generates random processes with the following parameters (Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority) based on the values given by user.

*Module 2:*
Processes Schedulers

This module implements the concept of scheduling processes. We implement 4 scheduling algorithms :

1. Non-Preemptive Highest Priority First. (HPF)
2. First Come First Served. (FCFS)
3. Round Robin with fixed time quantum. (RR)
4. Preemptive Shortest Remaining Time Next. (SRTN)

## How it works:-

## TBD

## Contributers :
Ahmed Adel - Ahmed Ibrahim
